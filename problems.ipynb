The **SHA-256** algorithm is a **cryptographic hash function** that turns a given input into a series of hexadecimal values **(fixed 256-bit hash)**. Hashes, unlike encryptions, are long and **cannot be reversed**. One input will always output the same hash code, making hashing extremely useful for something like storing and validating passwords. These blocks are small functions that work on **32-bit binary words**, and they mostly use **bitwise logic** like `XOR`, `AND`, `OR`, **rotations**, and **shifts**.\n",

    "### Theory / Background\n",
    "\n",
    "**SHA-256** is a **cryptographic hash function** from the [Secure Hash Standard (FIPS 180-4)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf), which provides the official specification for how the algorithm operates. Its job is to take any input and turn it into a **fixed 256-bit hash value**. This value is **one-way**, meaning you can't reverse it to get the original message. It's also **deterministic**, so the same input always gives the same output, and it's designed to **avoid collisions**, where two different inputs produce the same hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SHA-256** was developed by the [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-standards-and-guidelines) and released in **2001** as part of the **Secure Hash Standard (FIPS PUB 180-2)**. It was introduced to replace older hash functions like [**SHA-1**, which is now deprecated due to collision vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2), and to provide a stronger, modern hashing method for security, digital signatures, and data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works by splitting the message into **512-bit blocks** and running them through a series of **bitwise operations** like `XOR`, `AND`, **rotations**, and **shifts**. Understanding [bitwise operators in Python](https://realpython.com/python-bitwise-operators/) is essential for implementing these operations correctly. Functions such as `Ch`, `Maj`, and the `Sigma` functions help mix the bits so that even a **1-bit change in the input** causes a **completely different output**. This is called the **avalanche effect**, and it's a critical security property that prevents attackers from predicting how small changes affect the hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a visual walkthrough of how SHA-256 works internally, [this Computerphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMtFhACPnTY) provides an excellent explanation of how these building blocks fit into the compression function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Building Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "The seven functions I'm implementing in this problem are the fundamental **bitwise mixing operations** that SHA-256 uses internally. Additional context on [bitwise operations](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-bitwise-operators/) helps understand their behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Logical Functions (Parity, Ch, Maj):**\n",
    "These operate on three 32-bit words and produce one 32-bit output. They're used in different rounds of the compression function:\n",
    "- **Parity**: Simple XOR of all three inputs - produces 1 when an odd number of bits are 1\n",
    "- **Ch (Choose)**: Uses the first input as a selector to choose between the second and third inputs\n",
    "- **Maj (Majority)**: Returns the majority value for each bit position across the three inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Rotation Functions (Sigma0, Sigma1, sigma0, sigma1):**\n",
    "These perform **circular rotations** - bits shifted off one end wrap around to the other end. The uppercase Sigma functions use only rotations, while the lowercase sigma functions combine rotations with right shifts. These functions help spread the influence of each input bit across the entire output, creating strong **bit diffusion**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why 32-bit Operations?\n",
    "\n",
    "**SHA-256** operates exclusively on **32-bit words** because:\n",
    "- It provides a balance between security and performance\n",
    "- 32-bit operations are efficient on most modern processors\n",
    "- The 256-bit output is constructed from eight 32-bit words\n",
    "- All intermediate calculations stay within 32-bit boundaries, making overflow behavior predictable\n",
    "\n",
    "Using **NumPy's [`np.uint32` type](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.scalars.html#numpy.uint32)** ensures that all operations wrap around correctly at 32 bits, matching the exact behavior specified in the **FIPS 180-4** standard. This is crucial because Python's default integer type uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic and doesn't automatically wrap.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SHA-256** is widely used for **checking data integrity**, **digital signatures**, **blockchain technology** (like Bitcoin mining), and **general security tasks**."

    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "My strategy for implementing these functions follows a consistent pattern for each one, ensuring they match the **SHA-256** specification exactly:\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Implementation Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Type Conversion First:**\n",
    "For every function, I start by converting all inputs to [`np.uint32`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.scalars.html#numpy.uint32). This is critical because Python integers can be arbitrarily large, but SHA-256 requires strict 32-bit behavior. Without this conversion, operations like rotation and negation won't work correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Follow the Standard's Formulas:**\n",
    "Each function implements the exact bitwise formula specified in [**FIPS 180-4**](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf). I didn't try to optimize or simplify these - I wrote them exactly as defined because the security properties depend on these specific combinations of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Ensure 32-bit Output:**\n",
    "After computing the result, I convert it back to `np.uint32` to guarantee the output is also a proper 32-bit value. This prevents any unexpected type conversions or overflow issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function-Specific Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parity Function:**\n",
    "I implemented this using three XOR operations: `x ^ y ^ z`. The XOR operation naturally produces parity - it outputs 1 when an odd number of inputs are 1. This is a direct translation of the standard's definition and keeps the implementation simple and clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choose Function (Ch):**\n",
    "The formula `(x & y) ^ (~x & z)` might look complex, but it elegantly implements bit-selection logic. Where `x` has a 1-bit, the result takes the corresponding bit from `y`. Where `x` has a 0-bit (meaning `~x` has a 1-bit), the result takes the bit from `z`. This \"choosing\" behavior is why it's called the Choose function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Majority Function (Maj):**\n",
    "The expression `(x & y) ^ (x & z) ^ (y & z)` implements majority voting at the bit level. Each bit in the output is 1 if at least two of the corresponding input bits are 1. This works because the XOR of the three AND operations mathematically computes the majority value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rotation Functions (Sigma0, Sigma1, sigma0, sigma1):**\n",
    "For rotations, I use the pattern `(x >> n) | (x << (32-n))` ([common Python rotation implementation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5832982/how-to-get-the-logical-right-binary-rotation-in-python)):\n",
    "- The right shift `>>` moves bits to the right by `n` positions\n",
    "- The left shift `<<` moves bits to the left by `32-n` positions\n",
    "- The OR operation `|` combines them, creating the circular wrap-around effect\n",
    "\n",
    "The uppercase Sigma functions XOR three different rotations together. The lowercase sigma functions combine two rotations with a right shift (which doesn't wrap around - bits shifted off the end are lost).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Approach Works\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to implement each function exactly as specified rather than trying to be clever or optimize, because:\n",
    "- **Correctness is paramount** - cryptographic functions must be exact\n",
    "- **The standard's formulas are proven** - they provide the security properties SHA-256 needs\n",
    "- **Simplicity aids verification** - straightforward code is easier to test and review\n",
    "- **Performance is already good** - bitwise operations are extremely fast, so optimization isn't needed\n",
    "\n",
    "Each function is tested with multiple cases covering edge cases (all zeros, all ones), typical values, and specific patterns that verify the bitwise logic works correctly."

    "### Discussion / Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test Results\n",
    "\n",
    "All seven functions passed their comprehensive test suites, confirming that the implementations correctly follow the **FIPS 180-4** specification. The test cases covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Edge cases**: All zeros and all ones inputs\n",
    "- **Specific patterns**: Single bits, alternating patterns, known values\n",
    "- **Bit-level verification**: Binary representations to confirm exact bitwise behavior\n",
    "- **Consistency checks**: Operations with actual SHA constants\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Importance of Type Conversion:**\n",
    "During initial implementation, I discovered that failing to convert inputs to `np.uint32` caused incorrect behavior, especially with the negation operator `~` in the Choose function. Python's arbitrary-precision integers don't naturally wrap at 32 bits, so explicit type handling is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Rotation vs. Shift Distinction:**\n",
    "The difference between rotations (where bits wrap around) and shifts (where bits are lost) is critical for the sigma functions. The lowercase sigma functions combine both operations, creating different diffusion patterns than the uppercase Sigma functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Bitwise Logic Elegance:**\n",
    "The Choose and Majority functions demonstrate how elegant bitwise operations can be for implementing conditional logic without branches. The Choose function essentially implements a 32-way multiplexer, and Majority implements 32 simultaneous majority votes - all in just a few operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "The main challenge was ensuring that all operations stayed within 32-bit boundaries. Initially, some test cases failed because:\n",
    "- Python's default integer type doesn't automatically wrap at 32 bits\n",
    "- The negation operator behaves differently on unlimited-precision integers\n",
    "- Rotation amounts must account for the full 32-bit word size\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting all inputs to `np.uint32` at the start of each function and converting the result at the end solved these issues consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why These Functions Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "These building blocks appear throughout SHA-256's 64 rounds of processing. The Choose and Majority functions provide **nonlinearity** - they create complex relationships between bits that prevent attackers from predicting how changes propagate. The rotation functions provide **diffusion** - they spread the influence of each input bit across many output bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these functions create the **avalanche effect** that makes SHA-256 secure: changing even one bit in the input cascades through these operations to produce a completely different hash output."

    "### SHA-256 Message Preprocessing: Padding and Block Parsing\n",
    "\n",
    "The `block_parse(msg)` generator function implements the message preprocessing steps required by SHA-256, as specified in **Sections 5.1.1 and 5.2.1** of the Secure Hash Standard ([FIPS 180-4](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf)). Message preprocessing is the first stage of the hashing process, transforming variable-length input messages into standardized 512-bit blocks that the hash computation can process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Preprocessing Matters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "SHA-256's compression function operates on fixed-size 512-bit blocks. Since real-world messages rarely align perfectly with this block size, preprocessing ensures every message can be processed uniformly. The padding scheme also serves a security purpose: it prevents collision attacks where an attacker might craft different messages that produce identical padded outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Foundation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The padding equation *ℓ* + 1 + *k* + 64 ≡ 0 (mod 512) can be rearranged to *ℓ* + 1 + *k* ≡ 448 (mod 512). This guarantees that regardless of the original message length, after adding the '1' bit and appropriate zeros, exactly 64 bits remain in the final 512-bit block for the length field. The modular arithmetic ensures this works for messages requiring one padding block or spanning multiple blocks."
