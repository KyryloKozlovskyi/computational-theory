    "### My Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, I need to re-create some of the core building blocks used inside the **SHA-256 hashing algorithm**. The **SHA-256** algorithm is a **cryptographic hash function** that turns a given input into a series of hexadecimal values **(fixed 256-bit hash)**. Hashes, unlike encryptions, are long and **cannot be reversed**. One input will always output the same hash code, making hashing extremely useful for something like storing and validating passwords. These blocks are small functions that work on **32-bit binary words**, and they mostly use **bitwise logic** like `XOR`, `AND`, `OR`, **rotations**, and **shifts**.\n",

    "*Each function has a specific job in the hash process:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Parity`, `Ch`, and `Maj` take **three 32-bit** values and **combine** them using logic rules **(XOR, choose-between, or majority vote)**.\n",

    "### Theory / Background\n",
    "\n",
    "**SHA-256** is a **cryptographic hash function** from the [Secure Hash Standard (FIPS 180-4)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf), which provides the official specification for how the algorithm operates. Its job is to take any input and turn it into a **fixed 256-bit hash value**. This value is **one-way**, meaning you can't reverse it to get the original message. It's also **deterministic**, so the same input always gives the same output, and it's designed to **avoid collisions**, where two different inputs produce the same hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SHA-256** was developed by the [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-standards-and-guidelines) and released in **2001** as part of the **Secure Hash Standard (FIPS PUB 180-2)**. It was introduced to replace older hash functions like [SHA-1, which is now deprecated due to collision vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2), and to provide a stronger, modern hashing method for security, digital signatures, and data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works by splitting the message into **512-bit blocks** and running them through a series of **bitwise operations** like `XOR`, `AND`, **rotations**, and **shifts**. Understanding [bitwise operators in Python](https://realpython.com/python-bitwise-operators/) is essential for implementing these operations correctly. Functions such as `Ch`, `Maj`, and the `Sigma` functions help mix the bits so that even a **1-bit change in the input** causes a **completely different output**. This is called the **avalanche effect**, and it's a critical security property that prevents attackers from predicting how small changes affect the hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a visual walkthrough of how SHA-256 works internally, [this Computerphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMtFhACPnTY) provides an excellent explanation of how these building blocks fit into the compression function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Building Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "The seven functions I'm implementing in this problem are the fundamental **bitwise mixing operations** that SHA-256 uses internally. Additional context on [bitwise operations](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-bitwise-operators/) helps understand their behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Logical Functions (Parity, Ch, Maj):**\n",
    "These operate on three 32-bit words and produce one 32-bit output. They're used in different rounds of the compression function:\n",
    "- **Parity**: Simple XOR of all three inputs - produces 1 when an odd number of bits are 1\n",
    "- **Ch (Choose)**: Uses the first input as a selector to choose between the second and third inputs\n",
    "- **Maj (Majority)**: Returns the majority value for each bit position across the three inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Rotation Functions (Sigma0, Sigma1, sigma0, sigma1):**\n",
    "These perform **circular rotations** - bits shifted off one end wrap around to the other end. The uppercase Sigma functions use only rotations, while the lowercase sigma functions combine rotations with right shifts. These functions help spread the influence of each input bit across the entire output, creating strong **bit diffusion**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why 32-bit Operations?\n",
    "\n",
    "**SHA-256** operates exclusively on **32-bit words** because:\n",
    "- It provides a balance between security and performance\n",
    "- 32-bit operations are efficient on most modern processors\n",
    "- The 256-bit output is constructed from eight 32-bit words\n",
    "- All intermediate calculations stay within 32-bit boundaries, making overflow behavior predictable\n",
    "\n",
    "Using **NumPy's [np.uint32 type](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.scalars.html#numpy.uint32)** ensures that all operations wrap around correctly at 32 bits, matching the exact behavior specified in the **FIPS 180-4** standard. This is crucial because Python's default integer type uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic and doesn't automatically wrap.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SHA-256** is widely used for **checking data integrity**, **digital signatures**, **blockchain technology** (like Bitcoin mining), and **general security tasks**.\n",

    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "My strategy for implementing these functions follows a consistent pattern for each one, ensuring they match the **SHA-256** specification exactly:\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Implementation Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Type Conversion First:**\n",
    "For every function, I start by converting all inputs to [`np.uint32`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.scalars.html#numpy.uint32). This is critical because Python integers can be arbitrarily large, but SHA-256 requires strict 32-bit behavior. Without this conversion, operations like rotation and negation won't work correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Follow the Standard's Formulas:**\n",
    "Each function implements the exact bitwise formula specified in [**FIPS 180-4**](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf). I didn't try to optimize or simplify these - I wrote them exactly as defined because the security properties depend on these specific combinations of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Ensure 32-bit Output:**\n",
    "After computing the result, I convert it back to `np.uint32` to guarantee the output is also a proper 32-bit value. This prevents any unexpected type conversions or overflow issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function-Specific Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parity Function:**\n",
    "I implemented this using three XOR operations: `x ^ y ^ z`. The XOR operation naturally produces parity - it outputs 1 when an odd number of inputs are 1. This is a direct translation of the standard's definition and keeps the implementation simple and clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choose Function (Ch):**\n",
    "The formula `(x & y) ^ (~x & z)` might look complex, but it elegantly implements bit-selection logic. Where `x` has a 1-bit, the result takes the corresponding bit from `y`. Where `x` has a 0-bit (meaning `~x` has a 1-bit), the result takes the bit from `z`. This \"choosing\" behavior is why it's called the Choose function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Majority Function (Maj):**\n",
    "The expression `(x & y) ^ (x & z) ^ (y & z)` implements majority voting at the bit level. Each bit in the output is 1 if at least two of the corresponding input bits are 1. This works because the XOR of the three AND operations mathematically computes the majority value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rotation Functions (Sigma0, Sigma1, sigma0, sigma1):**\n",
    "For rotations, I use the pattern `(x >> n) | (x << (32-n))` ([common Python rotation implementation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5832982/how-to-get-the-logical-right-binary-rotation-in-python)):\n",
    "- The right shift `>>` moves bits to the right by `n` positions\n",
    "- The left shift `<<` moves bits to the left by `32-n` positions\n",
    "- The OR operation `|` combines them, creating the circular wrap-around effect\n",
    "\n",
    "The uppercase Sigma functions XOR three different rotations together. The lowercase sigma functions combine two rotations with a right shift (which doesn't wrap around - bits shifted off the end are lost).\n",

    "### Discussion / Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test Results\n",
    "\n",
    "All seven functions passed their comprehensive test suites, confirming that the implementations correctly follow the **FIPS 180-4** specification. The test cases covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Edge cases**: All zeros and all ones inputs\n",
    "- **Specific patterns**: Single bits, alternating patterns, known values\n",
    "- **Bit-level verification**: Binary representations to confirm exact bitwise behavior\n",
    "- **Consistency checks**: Operations with actual SHA constants\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Importance of Type Conversion:**\n",
    "During initial implementation, I discovered that failing to convert inputs to `np.uint32` caused incorrect behavior, especially with the negation operator `~` in the Choose function. Python's arbitrary-precision integers don't naturally wrap at 32 bits, so explicit type handling is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Rotation vs. Shift Distinction:**\n",
    "The difference between rotations (where bits wrap around) and shifts (where bits are lost) is critical for the sigma functions. The lowercase sigma functions combine both operations, creating different diffusion patterns than the uppercase Sigma functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Bitwise Logic:**\n",
    "The Choose and Majority functions demonstrate how bitwise operations can be for implementing conditional logic without branches. The Choose function essentially implements a 32-way multiplexer, and Majority implements 32 simultaneous majority votes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "The main challenge was ensuring that all operations stayed within 32-bit boundaries. Initially, some test cases failed because:\n",
    "- Python's default integer type doesn't automatically wrap at 32 bits\n",
    "- The negation operator behaves differently on unlimited-precision integers\n",
    "- Rotation amounts must account for the full 32-bit word size\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting all inputs to `np.uint32` at the start of each function and converting the result at the end solved these issues consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why These Functions Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "These building blocks appear throughout SHA-256's 64 rounds of processing. The Choose and Majority functions provide **nonlinearity** - they create complex relationships between bits that prevent attackers from predicting how changes propagate. The rotation functions provide **diffusion** - they spread the influence of each input bit across many output bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these functions create the **avalanche effect** that makes SHA-256 secure: changing even one bit in the input cascades through these operations to produce a completely different hash output.\n",

    "### My Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, I need to generate the **64 K constants** that SHA-256 uses in its compression function. These aren't arbitrary numbers - they come from the fractional parts of cube roots of the first 64 prime numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way I thought about it is that **cryptographic algorithms need constants that appear random but are actually derived from well-known mathematical values**. This approach, called \"nothing up my sleeve numbers,\" proves the constants weren't chosen to contain hidden weaknesses or backdoors. Anyone can verify these constants by computing the cube roots of primes themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Breaking it down:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate primes:** First, I need to find the first 64 prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ..., 311)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate cube roots:** For each prime, compute its cube root. For example, $\\sqrt[3]{2} \\approx 1.259921...$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Extract fractional part:** Take only the part after the decimal point. For $\\sqrt[3]{2}$, that's $0.259921...$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Get first 32 bits:** Multiply the fractional part by $2^{32}$ to shift it left 32 bits, then truncate to get an integer. This effectively extracts the first 32 binary digits of the fractional part.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Convert to hex:** Display as hexadecimal for easy comparison with the standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result should match exactly what's listed in **FIPS 180-4** on page 11, where all 64 constants are printed. These K constants are added to working variables during each of the 64 rounds of SHA-256's compression function, providing the \"random-looking\" mixing that makes the hash secure.\n",

    "### Theory / Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The SHA-256 K constants are defined in [Section 4.2.2 of FIPS 180-4](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf) (page 11). They represent an important design principle in modern cryptography: **verifiable randomness**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Use Cube Roots of Primes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptographic algorithms need constants that appear random but must be **transparently generated** to prove they don't contain hidden weaknesses. Using mathematical constants like cube roots of primes provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nothing Up My Sleeve**: Anyone can independently verify these constants by computing cube roots themselves\n",
    "2. **Unpredictability**: The fractional parts of cube roots produce pseudo-random bit patterns\n",
    "3. **Mathematical Beauty**: Connects SHA-256 to fundamental mathematics (prime numbers)\n",
    "4. **Historical Precedent**: Similar to how DES used the first 64 bits of $\\sqrt{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-standards-and-guidelines) chose this approach when designing SHA-256 in the late 1990s to ensure transparency and build trust in the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prime Numbers and Cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "[Prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) are fundamental building blocks in cryptography. While SHA-256 doesn't use primes for encryption (unlike RSA), using primes to generate constants connects the algorithm to well-understood number theory. The first 64 primes (2 through 311) provide enough distinct values for SHA-256's 64 rounds.\n",

    "The fractional part of a cube root represents the portion after the decimal point. When we multiply by $2^{32}$, we're essentially [shifting the binary representation](https://realpython.com/python-bitwise-operators/) left 32 positions. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\sqrt[3]{2} = 1.25992104989...$\n",
    "- Fractional part: $0.25992104989...$\n",
    "- In binary (first few bits): $0.01000011010111...$\n",
    "- Multiply by $2^{32}$: shifts left 32 bits\n",
    "- Truncate: gives the first 32 bits as an integer\n",
    "\n",
    "Using [NumPy's `cbrt` function](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.cbrt.html) provides the precision needed for this calculation, and [`np.uint32`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.scalars.html#numpy.uint32) ensures proper 32-bit wrapping.\n",

    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "My strategy for generating the K constants involves three main functions, each handling a specific part of the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Prime Generation: `primes(n)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:** Trial division with optimization\n",
    "- Start with candidate = 2\n",
    "- Check divisibility only against previously found primes\n",
    "- Stop checking when prime² > candidate (optimization)\n",
    "- Continue until we have n primes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this approach:**\n",
    "- Simple and readable for small n (64 is very manageable)\n",
    "- More sophisticated algorithms (Sieve of Eratosthenes) would be overkill\n",
    "- The [trial division method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_division) is intuitive and easy to verify\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation detail:** I use a list to accumulate primes and check each candidate against this growing list. For n=64, this runs instantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Fractional Part Extraction: `fractional_part_cube_root(prime)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:** Direct mathematical calculation\n",
    "1. Calculate cube root using [`np.cbrt()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.cbrt.html)\n",
    "2. Extract fractional part: `cube_root - floor(cube_root)`\n",
    "3. Scale by $2^{32}$ to get first 32 bits\n",
    "4. Convert to `np.uint32`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key consideration:** Using `np.cbrt()` instead of `prime**(1/3)` provides better numerical precision for floating-point calculations. The difference matters for cryptographic constants where every bit must be exact.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why multiply by $2^{32}$:**\n",
    "- The fractional part is between 0 and 1\n",
    "- Multiplying by $2^{32}$ shifts it to the integer range [0, $2^{32}-1$]\n",
    "- This extracts exactly 32 bits of the fractional part\n",
    "- Converting to `np.uint32` truncates (doesn't round) to get the integer portion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. K Constant Generation: `generate_k_constants(n=64)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:** Compose the previous two functions\n",
    "- Generate n primes using `primes(n)`\n",
    "- For each prime, calculate its K constant using `fractional_part_cube_root()`\n",
    "- Return both the K values and the primes (for verification)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Return value choice:** Returning both K values and primes allows test functions to verify:\n",
    "- Correct prime generation\n",
    "- Correct K constant calculation\n",
    "- Exact match with FIPS 180-4 specification\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Display Function: `display_hex_result()`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:** Format for human readability\n",
    "- Display 8 constants per line (matches FIPS 180-4 layout)\n",
    "- Use hexadecimal format with leading zeros: `0x{k:08x}`\n",
    "- Makes visual comparison with the standard trivial\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing Strategy:**\n",
    "- Test `primes()` against known values\n",
    "- Test `fractional_part_cube_root()` for correctness\n",
    "- Test complete K constant array against FIPS 180-4\n",
    "- All test functions use `assert` with descriptive error messages\n",
    "\n",
    "This modular approach makes each function simple to understand, test, and verify independently.\n",

    "### Discussion / Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Test Results\n",
    "\n",
    "All test functions passed, confirming that the implementation correctly generates the SHA-256 K constants according to **FIPS 180-4**:\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ **Prime generation verified**: The first 64 primes (2, 3, 5, ..., 311) are correctly generated  \n",
    "✓ **Fractional part calculation verified**: Cube root fractional parts are extracted accurately  \n",
    "✓ **K constants match standard**: All 64 constants exactly match those listed on page 11 of FIPS 180-4  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Precision Matters**\n",
    "Using `np.cbrt()` instead of `**(1/3)` provides the numerical precision needed for cryptographic constants. Even tiny floating-point errors would produce completely different K constants, breaking SHA-256 compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Mathematical Elegance**\n",
    "The K constants demonstrate how modern cryptography balances:\n",
    "- **Security**: Constants must appear random to prevent attacks\n",
    "- **Transparency**: Must be derivable from well-known mathematical values\n",
    "- **Verifiability**: Anyone can independently compute and verify them\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. \"Nothing Up My Sleeve\" Design**\n",
    "By publishing exactly how constants are generated, NIST proved SHA-256 doesn't contain hidden backdoors. If the NSA had simply said \"use these 64 random numbers,\" cryptographers would be suspicious. By saying \"use the first 32 bits of the fractional parts of cube roots of the first 64 primes,\" the constants are:\n",
    "- Provably derived from mathematics\n",
    "- Independently verifiable by anyone\n",
    "- Free from hidden structure or weaknesses\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Connection to Hash Security**\n",
    "These K constants are critical to SHA-256's security:\n",
    "- Added during each of 64 compression rounds\n",
    "- Prevent symmetry in the hash computation\n",
    "- Ensure each round produces different mixing patterns\n",
    "- Work together with the Ch, Maj, Sigma, and sigma functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Historical Context**\n",
    "The choice of cube roots (versus square roots or other powers) was deliberate:\n",
    "- Square roots used for H constants (initial hash values)\n",
    "- Cube roots used for K constants (round constants)\n",
    "- Fourth roots used in SHA-512\n",
    "- This variety prevents any single mathematical relationship between different constant sets\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Verification\n",
    "\n",
    "The final K constant array can be directly compared to **FIPS 180-4 page 11**. For example, the first 8 constants are:\n",
    "\n",
    "0x428a2f98, 0x71374491, 0xb5c0fbcf, 0xe9b5dba5,\n",
    "0x3956c25b, 0x59f111f1, 0x923f82a4, 0xab1c5ed5\n",
    "\n",
    "These match the standard exactly, confirming the implementation is correct. This verification is crucial - even a single incorrect constant would cause SHA-256 to produce completely wrong hashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practical Application\n",
    "\n",
    "While we don't typically regenerate these constants (they're usually hardcoded in SHA-256 implementations), understanding their derivation:\n",
    "- Demonstrates the transparency principle in cryptographic design\n",
    "- Provides confidence in the algorithm's integrity\n",
    "- Shows how mathematics grounds modern security\n",
    "- Illustrates the importance of reproducible, verifiable constants\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to independently derive and verify these constants is fundamental to trusting SHA-256 for critical applications like digital signatures, blockchain, password storage, and data integrity verification.\n",

    "### Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, I need to write a [generator function](https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators/) called `block_parse(msg)` that handles SHA-256's message preprocessing—specifically the padding step from [Sections 5.1.1 and 5.2.1 of FIPS 180-4](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "The requirements from `problems.md` are:\n",
    "1. Accept a [bytes object](https://realpython.com/python-bytes/) as input\n",
    "2. Use a generator function with `yield` to return blocks one at a time\n",
    "3. Output 512-bit (64-byte) blocks\n",
    "4. Add proper padding to the final block(s) per the standard\n",
    "5. Test with different message lengths to verify correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why padding matters:** SHA-256's compression function only works on fixed 512-bit blocks. Since real messages can be any length, padding ensures every message gets processed uniformly. The padding also prevents attacks where someone crafts different messages that produce the same padded output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The padding formula:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard specifies that after padding, the message length must satisfy: $(l + 1 + k) \\bmod 512 = 448$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $l$ = original message length in bits\n",
    "- $1$ = the mandatory '1' bit appended first\n",
    "- $k$ = number of '0' bits to add\n",
    "- $448$ = leaves exactly 64 bits for the length field\n",

    "### My Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "The way I thought about this problem: SHA-256 processes messages in 512-bit chunks, but messages in the real world don't come in neat 512-bit packages. You might hash \"hello\" (40 bits) or a whole file (millions of bits). The padding step makes everything fit into those 512-bit blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Breaking down what padding does:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a message that's 100 bytes (800 bits). That's not quite two 512-bit blocks (1024 bits), so you need to add some extra stuff to reach a clean multiple of 512. Here's what gets added:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **One '1' bit** - Always starts with a single 1 bit (in practice, this is the byte `0x80`)\n",
    "2. **Zero or more '0' bits** - As many zeros as needed to get to 448 bits before the next 512-bit boundary\n",
    "3. **64-bit length field** - The original message length (before padding) as a 64-bit number\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula $(l + 1 + k) \\bmod 512 = 448$ basically means \"add enough padding so you have exactly 64 bits left in the last block for the length.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why 448 and not 512?** Because you need to save room for that 64-bit length at the end. So $448 + 64 = 512$—a complete block.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The edge case:** If your message is already close to a block boundary and there's not enough room for the '1' bit plus the length field in the current block, you have to add a whole extra block of padding. That's why the standard says \"final block or final two blocks.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a [generator function](https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators/) with `yield` is perfect here because you can produce blocks one at a time as they're needed, rather than building the entire padded message in memory at once.\n",

    "### Theory / Background\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The SHA-256 Padding Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "SHA-256 padding is defined in [Section 5.1.1 of FIPS 180-4](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf). The specification is actually quite detailed in [RFC 6234](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6234#section-4.1), which provides working code examples. The padding scheme is identical across SHA-1, SHA-224, and SHA-256.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard says:\n",
    "> \"Suppose that the length of the message, M, is $l$ bits. Append the bit '1' to the end of the message, followed by $k$ zero bits, where $k$ is the smallest, non-negative solution to the equation $(l + 1 + k) \\bmod 512 = 448$. Then append the 64-bit block that is equal to the number $l$ expressed using a binary representation.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why This Padding Design?\n",
    "\n",
    "The padding serves two purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Technical necessity:** SHA-256's compression function requires fixed 512-bit blocks. Without padding, messages that aren't multiples of 512 bits couldn't be processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Security:** The '1' bit followed by '0' bits creates an unambiguous message boundary. Without it, you could have [length extension attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_extension_attack) where an attacker appends data to a message and still produces a valid hash. The 64-bit length field at the end makes this much harder.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Working Through an Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's pad the message \"abc\" (which is 3 bytes = 24 bits). Following [RFC 6234's example](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6234#section-4.1):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Original: `01100001 01100010 01100011` (24 bits)\n",
    "2. Add '1' bit: `01100001 01100010 01100011 1` (25 bits)\n",
    "3. Calculate padding: $(24 + 1 + k) \\bmod 512 = 448$ → $k = 423$ zeros needed\n",
    "4. After zeros: 448 bits total\n",
    "5. Add length (24 as 64-bit): 64 more bits\n",
    "6. Final: 512 bits (exactly one block)\n",
    "\n",
    "In hex, this becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "61 62 63 80 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n",
    "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n",
    "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n",
    "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 18\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: `0x80` = `10000000` in binary (the '1' bit), and `0x18` = 24 in decimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generator Functions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A [generator function](https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators/) uses `yield` instead of `return`, which makes it produce values one at a time rather than all at once. This is perfect for processing large messages that might not fit in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to [Real Python's guide](https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators/), generators:\n",
    "- Are memory efficient (don't store all blocks at once)\n",
    "- Can represent infinite sequences\n",
    "- Maintain state between yields\n",
    "\n",
    "For SHA-256 padding, this means we can process files of any size by yielding blocks as we go.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bytes Objects in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's [bytes type](https://realpython.com/python-bytes/) represents immutable sequences of bytes (values 0-255). According to [Python's documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes), bytes are perfect for binary data like SHA-256 messages because:\n",
    "- Each element is exactly 8 bits\n",
    "- Supports slicing and indexing\n",

    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "My strategy for `block_parse(msg)` breaks the problem into clear steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Calculate Padding Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "First, figure out how much padding is needed:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "message_length_bits = len(msg) * 8  # Convert bytes to bits\n",
    "k = (448 - (message_length_bits + 1)) % 512  # Padding zeros needed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `% 512` handles the wraparound when `message_length_bits + 1` is already past 448 in the current block.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Build the Padding Bytes\n",
    "\n",
    "The padding consists of:\n",
    "- One `0x80` byte (which is `10000000` in binary—the mandatory '1' bit followed by seven '0' bits)\n",
    "- Enough `0x00` bytes to reach the right position\n",
    "- Eight bytes for the 64-bit message length\n",
    "\n",
    "I calculate how many zero bytes are needed:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "padding_zeros = (k - 7) // 8  # -7 because 0x80 already has 7 zero bits\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then construct the padding:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "padding = b'\\x80' + (b'\\x00' * padding_zeros) + message_length_bits.to_bytes(8, 'big')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Using `'big'` [endianness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness) because FIPS 180-4 specifies big-endian (most significant byte first).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Yield Blocks Using a Generator\n",
    "\n",
    "The function yields blocks in three phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 1: Complete blocks from the original message**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(0, len(msg), 64):\n",
    "    if i + 64 <= len(msg):\n",
    "        yield msg[i:i+64]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 2: Partial block plus padding (if any)**\n",
    "\n",
    "If there's a leftover partial block, concatenate it with padding and yield:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "last_block = msg[full_blocks * 64:]\n",
    "combined = last_block + padding\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 3: Handle padding overflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the combined block exceeds 64 bytes, split it into two blocks:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if len(combined) > 64:\n",
    "    yield combined[:64]  # First part\n",
    "    yield combined[64:]  # Remaining padding\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This handles the case where there's not enough room in the final message block for all the padding.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why This Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm guarantees:\n",
    "- All yielded blocks are exactly 64 bytes (512 bits)\n",
    "- The final block always ends with the 64-bit length\n",
    "- The padding always starts with `0x80` after the message\n",
    "- Total padded length is always a multiple of 512 bits\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Testing Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Following `problems.md`, I test with different message lengths:\n",
    "- Empty message (0 bytes)\n",
    "- Very short message (1 byte) \n",
    "- Message just under 1 block (55 bytes - edge case)\n",
    "- Message just over 1 block (64 bytes)\n",
    "- Multi-block message (100+ bytes)\n",
    "\n",
    "All tests verify:\n",
    "1. Correct number of blocks produced\n",
    "2. All blocks are 64 bytes\n",
    "3. Padding bytes are correct\n",
    "4. Length field matches original message length\n",

    "### Discussion / Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "All my test cases passed, confirming the padding implementation matches FIPS 180-4:\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ Empty message produces 1 block (all padding)  \n",
    "✓ Short messages pad correctly  \n",
    "✓ Edge case (55 bytes) triggers 2-block padding correctly  \n",
    "✓ Multi-block messages yield correct number of blocks  \n",
    "✓ All blocks are exactly 512 bits  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What I Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "**The modular arithmetic is clever.** At first, the formula $(l + 1 + k) \\bmod 512 = 448$ looked complicated, but it's actually elegant. It automatically handles both cases—when padding fits in the current block and when you need an extra block—without needing separate logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The '1' bit is critical for security.** I read about [length extension attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_extension_attack) where attackers could append data to hashed messages. The mandatory '1' bit creates an unambiguous boundary between the original message and padding, preventing this attack. Without it, `message + padding` could be ambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generators are perfect for this.** Using `yield` means the function can handle messages of any size without loading everything into memory at once. For a 1GB file, the function only keeps one 64-byte block in memory at a time. This follows [Python's generator best practices](https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators/#when-to-use-a-generator-expression).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Edge cases matter.** The trickiest case is when a message is 55-63 bytes long. There's room for the `0x80` byte but not for the full 8-byte length field. The padding has to spill into a second block. My initial implementation missed this and failed on 56-byte messages until I added the overflow check.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Big-endian for the length field.** FIPS 180-4 specifies [big-endian byte order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness) for the length field. Python's `.to_bytes(8, 'big')` handles this correctly. If you accidentally used `'little'`, the hash would be completely wrong but the code wouldn't crash—it's a subtle bug.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Connection to Hash Security\n",
    "\n",
    "Proper padding is crucial for SHA-256's security properties. Without the length field at the end, two different messages could pad to the same value and produce the same hash (a collision). The padding scheme ensures that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Every unique message produces a unique padded value\n",
    "2. The padding is deterministic (same message always pads the same way)\n",
    "3. You can't trick the hash by manipulating padding\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why the standard is so specific about the exact padding format—it's not just about making blocks the right size, it's about preventing attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practical Verification\n",
    "\n",
    "You can verify the padding by comparing with known test vectors from [RFC 6234 Appendix](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6234#appendix-B). For \"abc\", the padded message should be:\n",

    "### My Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "The way I thought about this problem: the `hash()` function is where all the pieces from Problems 1, 2, and 3 come together. It's the actual **compression function** that takes a message block and mixes it with the current hash state to produce a new hash state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Breaking down the inputs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`current`:** This is an 8-element list representing the current hash state (H^(i-1)). These are eight 32-bit integers (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h) that carry forward from one block to the next. For the first block, these come from the **initial hash values** defined in FIPS 180-4 Section 5.3.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`block`:** This is 64 bytes (512 bits) of message data from the `block_parse()` generator we wrote in Problem 3. Each block gets processed independently, but the hash state carries forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happens inside the function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Message Schedule Preparation (W[0..63]):**\n",
    "   - First 16 words (W[0..15]) come directly from the block\n",
    "   - Remaining 48 words (W[16..63]) are computed using **sigma0** and **sigma1** from Problem 1\n",
    "   - Formula: $W_t = \\sigma_1(W_{t-2}) + W_{t-7} + \\sigma_0(W_{t-15}) + W_{t-16}$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialize Working Variables:**\n",
    "   - Copy the 8 hash values into working variables: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h\n",
    "   - These will be modified through 64 rounds of mixing\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Main Loop (64 rounds):**\n",
    "   - Each round computes two temporary values:\n",
    "     - $T_1 = h + \\Sigma_1(e) + Ch(e, f, g) + K_t + W_t$\n",
    "     - $T_2 = \\Sigma_0(a) + Maj(a, b, c)$\n",
    "   - Updates all 8 working variables using specific rotation\n",
    "   - Uses the **Ch, Maj, Sigma0, Sigma1** functions from Problem 1\n",
    "   - Uses the **K constants** from Problem 2\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compute Intermediate Hash:**\n",
    "   - Add each working variable back to the corresponding hash value\n",
    "   - This ensures that every bit influences the final output\n",
    "\n",
    "**The clever part:** Even though we're processing the block sequentially (64 rounds), the mixing is designed so that changing even one bit in the input block completely changes the output. That's the **avalanche effect** that makes SHA-256 cryptographically secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it's called a compression function:** We're taking 512 bits of input (the block) plus 256 bits of state (current hash) and compressing it down to 256 bits of output (new hash state). Information is being mixed and condensed, not preserved.\n",

    "### Theory / Background\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The SHA-256 Compression Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The compression function is specified in [FIPS 180-4, Section 6.2.2](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf) on page 22. It's based on the **Merkle-Damgård construction**, a well-studied cryptographic design that builds a hash function from a compression function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Merkle-Damgård construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle%E2%80%93Damg%C3%A5rd_construction) was proven by Ralph Merkle and Ivan Damgård to be **collision-resistant** if the underlying compression function is collision-resistant. This means if it's hard to find two different inputs that compress to the same output, then it's hard to find two different messages with the same hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Message Schedule (W array)\n",
    "\n",
    "The message schedule expands the 512-bit block into 64 words using the formulas from [FIPS 180-4, Section 6.2.2, Step 1](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf):\n",
    "\n",
    "**For t = 0 to 15:**\n",
    "$$W_t = M_t^{(i)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the first 16 words directly from the message block.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For t = 16 to 63:**\n",
    "$$W_t = \\sigma_1^{(256)}(W_{t-2}) + W_{t-7} + \\sigma_0^{(256)}(W_{t-15}) + W_{t-16}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This expansion ensures that each of the 64 rounds operates on a unique combination of the original message bits. The **sigma0** and **sigma1** functions (from Problem 1) mix the bits through rotation and XOR operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The 64 Rounds\n",
    "\n",
    "Each round performs the following operations (from [FIPS 180-4, Section 6.2.2, Step 3](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf)):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T_1 = h + \\Sigma_1^{(256)}(e) + Ch(e, f, g) + K_t^{(256)} + W_t$$\n",
    "$$T_2 = \\Sigma_0^{(256)}(a) + Maj(a, b, c)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the working variables are updated:\n",
    "- $h = g$\n",
    "- $g = f$\n",
    "- $f = e$\n",
    "- $e = d + T_1$\n",
    "- $d = c$\n",
    "- $c = b$\n",
    "- $b = a$\n",
    "- $a = T_1 + T_2$\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a **circular dependency** where each working variable depends on all the previous ones. After 64 rounds, all 8 variables have been thoroughly mixed with the message and the K constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why 64 Rounds?\n",
    "\n",
    "The number 64 comes from the block size (512 bits ÷ 8 bits per round = 64). More rounds means more mixing and higher security, but also slower computation. NIST chose 64 as a balance—enough to ensure security (no known attacks succeed with 64 rounds) but not so many that it's impractical.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to [cryptographic research on SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2#Cryptanalysis_and_validation), reduced-round versions (like SHA-256 with only 31 rounds) have known weaknesses, but the full 64-round version has withstood extensive cryptanalysis since its publication in 2001.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initial Hash Values\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first block, `current` is initialized using the **H constants** from [FIPS 180-4, Section 5.3.3](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf). Like the K constants from Problem 2, these come from the fractional parts of square roots of the first 8 primes—another \"nothing up my sleeve\" design:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "H = [\n",
    "    0x6a09e667,  # sqrt(2)\n",
    "    0xbb67ae85,  # sqrt(3)\n",
    "    0x3c6ef372,  # sqrt(5)\n",
    "    0xa54ff53a,  # sqrt(7)\n",
    "    0x510e527f,  # sqrt(11)\n",
    "    0x9b05688c,  # sqrt(13)\n",
    "    0x1f83d9ab,  # sqrt(17)\n",
    "    0x5be0cd19   # sqrt(19)\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Avalanche Effect\n",
    "\n",
    "A good cryptographic hash function exhibits the **avalanche effect**: changing even a single bit in the input should change approximately half the bits in the output. SHA-256 achieves this through:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Non-linear functions:** Ch and Maj create complex interactions between bits\n",
    "2. **Multiple rounds:** 64 rounds ensure thorough mixing\n",
    "3. **Rotation operations:** Sigma functions spread bit changes across words\n",
    "4. **Modular addition:** Causes bit changes to propagate (carry bits)\n",
    "\n",
    "Research shows that SHA-256 achieves [near-perfect avalanche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_effect#In_cryptography) after just 10-15 rounds, but uses 64 for a large security margin.\n",

    "I extract 4 bytes at a time from the block and convert to a 32-bit integer using **big-endian** byte order (as required by FIPS 180-4). The block is 64 bytes, so this gives us 16 words.\n",

    "**Remaining 48 words** are computed using the expansion formula:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for t in range(16, 64):\n",
    "    s0 = sigma0(W[t-15])\n",
    "    s1 = sigma1(W[t-2])\n",
    "    W[t] = (W[t-16] + s0 + W[t-7] + s1) & 0xFFFFFFFF\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I use the **sigma0** and **sigma1** functions from Problem 1 and mask with `0xFFFFFFFF` to ensure 32-bit arithmetic (prevents Python's arbitrary-precision integers from causing problems).\n",

    "### Discussion / Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "All test cases passed, verifying that the `hash()` function correctly implements the SHA-256 compression function:\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ Empty message produces the correct hash: `e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855`  \n",
    "✓ \"abc\" produces the standard test vector: `ba7816bf8f01cfea414140de5dae2223b00361a396177a9cb410ff61f20015ad`  \n",
    "✓ Multi-block messages process correctly with state carrying forward  \n",
    "\n",
    "These match the official test vectors from [RFC 6234](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6234#appendix-B), confirming the implementation follows FIPS 180-4 exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What I Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "**The compression function is where the magic happens.** All the preliminary work (bitwise functions in Problem 1, K constants in Problem 2, padding in Problem 3) comes together here. The 64 rounds of mixing ensure that even a single bit change in the input completely changes the output hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "**32-bit arithmetic is critical everywhere.** Python's unlimited precision integers would break SHA-256 if I didn't mask with `0xFFFFFFFF` after every operation. The modular arithmetic (wrapping at $2^{32}$) is part of what makes SHA-256 work—it causes carries that spread bit changes throughout the hash state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The feed-forward step prevents attacks.** Adding the working variables back to the previous hash state (Step 4) is crucial. Without it, an attacker could potentially reverse the compression function. The feed-forward makes the function irreversible because you need both the output and the previous state to work backwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The message schedule expansion is clever.** Starting with 16 words and expanding to 64 means each round operates on a unique mix of the original message bits. The sigma functions ensure good diffusion—every bit of the original message affects many bits in the expanded schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why SHA-256 is secure:** The security comes from three properties working together:\n",
    "1. **Preimage resistance:** Given a hash, you can't find the original message (one-way)\n",
    "2. **Second preimage resistance:** Given a message, you can't find another message with the same hash\n",
    "3. **Collision resistance:** You can't find any two messages with the same hash\n",
    "\n",
    "The 64 rounds, non-linear functions, and 256-bit output size make all three computationally infeasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "The `hash()` function is the **performance bottleneck** in SHA-256. For a 1MB file:\n",
    "- Padding (Problem 3): ~2000 blocks generated (fast, O(n) with file size)\n",
    "- Hashing (Problem 4): ~2000 × 64 rounds = 128,000 operations (slower, O(n × 64))\n",
    "\n",
    "Each round involves:\n",
    "- 2 Sigma function calls (rotation/XOR)\n",
    "- 2 Ch/Maj function calls (bitwise logic)\n",
    "- Several 32-bit additions\n",
    "- Variable reassignments\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern CPUs have specialized instructions for these operations (like Intel's SHA extensions), but our pure Python implementation is much slower. Still, it demonstrates the algorithm correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Connection to Password Hashing (Problem 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "This compression function is what makes SHA-256 useful for password hashing. When you hash a password:\n",
    "1. Convert password string to bytes (UTF-8 encoding)\n",
    "2. Pad the bytes (Problem 3)\n",
    "3. Process through compression function (Problem 4)\n",
    "4. Output is the password hash\n",
    "\n",
    "However, SHA-256 alone is **too fast** for password hashing in production. Modern password hashing uses functions like **bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2** that are intentionally slow to resist brute-force attacks. We'll explore this in Problem 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Verification Against Standards\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation can be verified by:\n",
    "- Comparing against Python's `hashlib.sha256()` for any input\n",
    "- Checking RFC 6234 test vectors\n",
    "- Confirming intermediate values match FIPS 180-4 examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Every detail matters—using big-endian instead of little-endian, or forgetting a single `& 0xFFFFFFFF`, produces completely wrong results. This is why cryptographic implementations require such careful attention to the specification."

    "Given three SHA-256 password hashes, determine the original passwords and explain how they were found. Then suggest improvements to prevent such attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Challenge:\n",
    "\n",
    "Three common passwords were hashed using **one pass** of SHA-256 with [UTF-8 encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8`\n",

    "\n",

    "3. **Suggest improvements:** Propose better password hashing practices to prevent these attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters:\n",
    "\n",
    "Password security is critical in real-world systems. Understanding how passwords can be cracked helps us design better security. This problem demonstrates why **single-pass SHA-256 is insufficient** for password storage despite being cryptographically secure for other purposes.\n",

    "### My Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "The way I understood this: I have three hashes and need to work backwards to find the passwords. Since SHA-256 is a one-way function, I can't just reverse it mathematically. But the problem says these are \"common passwords,\" which means I should be able to find them by hashing common passwords and comparing the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what's actually happening. Someone took three passwords, encoded them as UTF-8 bytes, ran them through SHA-256 once, and got these hash values. Because SHA-256 is deterministic - meaning the same input always gives the same output - if I hash \"password\" and get a certain result, anyone else hashing \"password\" will get that exact same hash. This is both useful (for verification) and problematic (for security).\n",
    "\n",
    "My approach was to create a list of common passwords and hash each one until I found matches. This is called a dictionary attack. It works because:\n",
    "\n",
    "The hash function is fast - SHA-256 can compute billions of hashes per second on a modern GPU. There's no salt - every instance of \"password\" hashes to the same value everywhere. The passwords are common - they're probably in lists of frequently used passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without any additional protections like salting or key stretching, finding these passwords is straightforward. I basically just need to:\n",
    "1. Get a list of common passwords\n",
    "2. Hash each one with SHA-256 \n",
    "3. Compare the results to the three target hashes\n",
    "4. When there's a match, that's the password\n",
    "\n",
    "I considered using online services like CrackStation that have precomputed rainbow tables with billions of hashes. These would give instant results for common passwords. But I decided to implement the dictionary attack myself to actually understand how the attack works rather than just using a tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental security problem here is that SHA-256 alone is way too fast for password hashing. What makes it great for verifying file integrity or blockchain applications makes it terrible for passwords. A modern GPU can test billions of passwords per second, so even a wordlist with millions of entries takes less than a second to check."

    "### Theory / Background\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why SHA-256 Isn't Enough for Passwords\n",
    "\n",
    "SHA-256 is designed to be fast because it's meant for things like checksums and data verification. According to [hashcat benchmarks](https://gist.github.com/epixoip/ace60d09981be09544fdd35005051505), a high-end GPU can compute around 130 billion SHA-256 hashes per second. For password cracking, this means:\n",
    "- Testing a million common passwords: about 0.008 seconds\n",
    "- All 8-character lowercase passwords: a few hours\n",
    "- The three passwords in this problem: essentially instant\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem isn't that SHA-256 is cryptographically weak. It's still secure for what it was designed for. But its speed, combined with being deterministic and having no memory requirements, makes it easy to parallelize password cracking on GPUs or specialized hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dictionary Attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem I used a dictionary attack, which means trying passwords from a list of common ones. There are several well-known password lists from actual breaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "The [RockYou breach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RockYou) from 2009 exposed 32 million passwords that were stored in plaintext. This became one of the most-used wordlists for password cracking because it shows what people actually choose. Lists like [NordPass's top 200 most common passwords](https://nordpass.com/most-common-passwords-list/) are updated annually based on breach data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary attacks work well when passwords are common and there's no salt. If I'm trying to crack \"password\" and there's no salt, I only need to hash \"password\" once and I can check it against millions of hashes in databases. That's why rainbow tables are effective - they're precomputed dictionaries mapping common passwords to their hashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Password Security Has Changed\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at how password storage has evolved helps explain why we need more than just SHA-256:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1970s through 1990s, passwords were often stored in plaintext. If someone got access to the database, they had every password immediately. This was obviously terrible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1990s and 2000s, systems started using basic hashing with MD5 or SHA-1. This was better since you couldn't directly read the passwords, but these hashes are fast and rainbow tables made them easy to crack. The LinkedIn breach in 2012 used unsalted SHA-1, and attackers cracked most of the 117 million passwords within days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Around 2000-2010, people realized you need to add random data (salt) to each password before hashing. This prevents rainbow tables because each password needs its own precomputed table. But fast hash functions were still a problem - you could still brute force individual passwords quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern systems use specialized password hashing functions like [bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt), [scrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt), or [Argon2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2). These are intentionally slow and use significant memory, making them much harder to crack even with specialized hardware. Argon2 won the Password Hashing Competition in 2015 and is now recommended by [OWASP](https://cheatsheetsec.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real Breaches Show Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between good and bad password hashing is clear when you look at actual breaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "LinkedIn (2012) used unsalted SHA-1. Result: 90% of passwords cracked within a few days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adobe (2013) had 153 million passwords with weak encryption. Most were cracked.\n",
    "\n",
    "RockYou (2009) stored passwords in plaintext. All 32 million were immediately exposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare that to LastPass (2022), which uses bcrypt with 100,100 iterations plus PBKDF2. Even though attackers got the encrypted vaults, the properly hashed master passwords remain uncracked years later.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### UTF-8 Encoding Details\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem specifies [UTF-8 encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8), which matters because SHA-256 operates on bytes, not text. Before hashing, the password string needs to be converted to bytes. Different encodings would produce different hashes even for the same text. UTF-8 is standard for web applications and handles special characters properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, \"P@ssw0rd\" in UTF-8 is the byte sequence: `0x50 0x40 0x73 0x73 0x77 0x30 0x72 0x64` (8 bytes total).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Core Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The irony is that SHA-256 is excellent at what it was designed for but completely wrong for passwords. For checksums, certificates, and blockchain, you want:\n",
    "- Fast computation\n",
    "- Deterministic output\n",
    "- Easy to verify\n",
    "\n",
    "But for passwords, these same properties are vulnerabilities:\n",
    "- Fast means attackers can try billions per second\n",
    "- Deterministic means rainbow tables work\n",
    "- No memory cost means easy parallelization\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not that SHA-256 is broken. It's that using it alone for passwords is using the wrong tool for the job."

    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How I Implemented the Dictionary Attack\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I created a simple function to hash strings with SHA-256:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def sha256_utf8(text):\n",
    "    return hashlib.sha256(text.encode(\"utf-8\")).hexdigest()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This takes a text string, converts it to UTF-8 bytes, hashes it with SHA-256, and returns the hexadecimal string. I used Python's built-in hashlib instead of our Problem 4 implementation because it's optimized and standard practice for production code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the password dictionary, I started with about 20 common passwords and kept expanding it based on which types of passwords are most common in breach databases. The final list had around 50 entries including:\n",
    "- Numeric sequences like \"123456\" and \"1234567890\"\n",
    "- Common words like \"password\", \"admin\", \"welcome\"\n",
    "- Food and objects like \"cheese\", \"chocolate\", \"coffee\"\n",
    "- Leetspeak variations like \"P@ssw0rd\" and \"Pa$$w0rd\"\n",
    "- Common names and patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "I stored the target hashes in a dictionary structure so lookups would be fast:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "target_hashes = {\n",
    "    \"5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8\": None,\n",
    "    \"873ac9ffea4dd04fa719e8920cd6938f0c23cd678af330939cff53c3d2855f34\": None,\n",
    "    \"b03ddf3ca2e714a6548e7495e2a03f5e824eaac9837cd7f159c67b90fb4b7342\": None\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual attack is just a loop:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for pwd in common_passwords:\n",
    "    hashed = sha256_utf8(pwd)\n",
    "    if hashed in target_hashes:\n",
    "        target_hashes[hashed] = pwd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For each password in my list, I hash it and check if it matches any of the three target hashes. When there's a match, I store the password.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The attack found all three passwords:\n",
    "\n",
    "**password** → 5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8\n",
    "\n",
    "This is literally the most common password in every breach database. It shows up in almost every password list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**cheese** → 873ac9ffea4dd04fa719e8920cd6938f0c23cd678af330939cff53c3d2855f34\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple dictionary word. People choose food names surprisingly often for passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "**P@ssw0rd** → b03ddf3ca2e714a6548e7495e2a03f5e824eaac9837cd7f159c67b90fb4b7342\n",
    "\n",
    "This is leetspeak - substituting @ for 'a' and 0 for 'o'. Users think this makes passwords more secure, but it's such a common pattern that it's in every wordlist. It doesn't add much protection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole attack took less than a millisecond because the wordlist was small and SHA-256 is fast. Even with millions of passwords to test, it would only take a second or two.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "I wrote tests to verify the function works correctly:\n",
    "- Test the three cracked password hashes\n",
    "- Test the empty string (should match the empty message hash from Problem 4)\n",
    "- Test that SHA-256 is case-sensitive\n",
    "- Test that it's deterministic (same input always gives same output)\n",
    "- Test that different inputs give different outputs\n",
    "- Test that the output is always 64 hexadecimal characters\n",
    "\n",
    "All tests passed, confirming the implementation matches the SHA-256 standard."

    "### Discussion / Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why the Attack Worked\n",
    "\n",
    "The dictionary attack succeeded for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, all three passwords were common. \"password\" is the #1 most used password globally. \"cheese\" appears in breach databases. \"P@ssw0rd\" is a predictable variation. If the passwords had been random strings like \"xK9#mL2p\", a dictionary attack wouldn't work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, there was no salt. Because every instance of \"password\" produces the same hash, I only needed to hash each password once. If each password had been salted with random data, I'd need to try every combination of salt and password, which is computationally infeasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, SHA-256 is extremely fast. Even testing millions of passwords takes under a second on a regular computer. On a GPU, it would be billions per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, leetspeak doesn't help as much as people think. \"P@ssw0rd\" seems more secure than \"Password\", but attackers know about common substitutions (@ for a, 0 for o, 1 for i, etc.) and include them in wordlists.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to Actually Secure Passwords\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on what I learned, here are ways to prevent dictionary attacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Add Salt**\n",
    "\n",
    "The first improvement is adding unique random data to each password before hashing:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "salt = os.urandom(16)  # 16 random bytes\n",
    "combined = salt + password.encode('utf-8')\n",
    "hashed = hashlib.sha256(combined).digest()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This means even if two users have the same password, their hashes will be completely different. Rainbow tables become useless because you'd need a separate table for every possible salt value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The catch is you need to store the salt alongside the hash so you can verify the password later. But that's fine because the salt doesn't need to be secret - it just needs to be unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Stretching**\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with salt, SHA-256 is still too fast. The solution is to hash repeatedly:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def hash_with_iterations(password, salt, iterations=100000):\n",
    "    result = password.encode('utf-8') + salt\n",
    "    for i in range(iterations):\n",
    "        result = hashlib.sha256(result).digest()\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you hash 100,000 times instead of once, you make the attacker's job 100,000 times harder. For a legitimate user logging in, this adds maybe 0.1 seconds - barely noticeable. But for an attacker trying millions of passwords, it makes the attack take months instead of seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has this built in as PBKDF2:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac('sha256', password.encode('utf-8'), salt, 100000)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Proper Password Hashing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Even better than PBKDF2 is using a function designed specifically for passwords. The current recommendation is Argon2, which won the Password Hashing Competition in 2015:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from argon2 import PasswordHasher\n",
    "ph = PasswordHasher()\n",
    "hash = ph.hash(password)  # Automatically handles salting\n",
    "ph.verify(hash, password)  # Check if password matches\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Argon2 is both slow and memory-intensive, making it resistant to GPU and ASIC attacks. Alternative options are bcrypt and scrypt, which are also good choices and more widely supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "bcrypt has been around since 1999 and is used by Django, Rails, and many other frameworks:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import bcrypt\n",
    "salt = bcrypt.gensalt()\n",
    "hashed = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), salt)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of these specialized functions is they're designed to be adjustable. As computers get faster, you can increase the work factor to keep passwords secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Layers**\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with strong hashing, other security measures help:\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding a \"pepper\" - a secret key stored separately from the database. Even if someone steals the database, they still need the pepper to attempt cracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rate limiting login attempts to prevent brute force attacks on the login page itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-factor authentication so even if the password is compromised, the attacker still can't get in.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Makes Good Password Security\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the LastPass breach from 2022 shows what proper security looks like. Even though attackers got the encrypted vaults, the master passwords used bcrypt with over 100,000 iterations. Years later, those passwords still haven't been cracked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare that to LinkedIn in 2012, where unsalted SHA-1 meant 90% of passwords were cracked in days.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference isn't that bcrypt is mathematically stronger than SHA-256. It's that bcrypt is designed for passwords - it's intentionally slow, memory-hard, and includes salting automatically. SHA-256 is designed for speed and efficiency, which is perfect for checksums but terrible for passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-World Costs\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what it costs attackers to crack passwords with different methods (rough estimates for a million passwords):\n",
    "\n",
    "SHA-256 with no salt: 0.008 seconds, essentially free\n",
    "SHA-256 with 100,000 iterations: 12 minutes, costs a few cents\n",
    "bcrypt with cost factor 12: 8 hours, around $3\n",
    "Argon2 with 64MB memory: 80 hours, around $25\n",
    "\n",
    "These are approximate but show how proper hashing dramatically increases the cost and time needed to crack passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What I Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest takeaway is that cryptographic security isn't just about having a strong algorithm. SHA-256 is cryptographically secure, but using it wrong makes passwords vulnerable. Context matters - the same function that's perfect for verifying file integrity is completely inadequate for passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cracking passwords turned out to be easier than I expected. With just a basic wordlist and a few lines of code, I found all three passwords almost instantly. This really shows why password policies matter and why systems need proper hashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The leetspeak thing surprised me too. I would have thought \"P@ssw0rd\" was more secure than \"password\", but it barely makes a difference when attackers know about these patterns. Real security comes from length and randomness, not character substitutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, seeing how breaches like LinkedIn and RockYou affected millions of people makes it clear why this matters. Bad password hashing isn't just a theoretical problem - it has real consequences when databases get stolen."
