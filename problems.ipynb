    "### My Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, I need to re-create some of the core building blocks used inside the **SHA-256 hashing algorithm**. The **SHA-256** algorithm is a **cryptographic hash function** that turns a given input into a series of hexadecimal values **(fixed 256-bit hash)**. Hashes, unlike encryptions, are long and **cannot be reversed**. One input will always output the same hash code, making hashing extremely useful for something like storing and validating passwords. These blocks are small functions that work on **32-bit binary words**, and they mostly use **bitwise logic** like `XOR`, `AND`, `OR`, **rotations**, and **shifts**.\n",

    "*Each function has a specific job in the hash process:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Parity`, `Ch`, and `Maj` take **three 32-bit** values and **combine** them using logic rules **(XOR, choose-between, or majority vote)**.\n",

    "### Theory / Background\n",
    "\n",
    "**SHA-256** is a **cryptographic hash function** from the [Secure Hash Standard (FIPS 180-4)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf), which provides the official specification for how the algorithm operates. Its job is to take any input and turn it into a **fixed 256-bit hash value**. This value is **one-way**, meaning you can't reverse it to get the original message. It's also **deterministic**, so the same input always gives the same output, and it's designed to **avoid collisions**, where two different inputs produce the same hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SHA-256** was developed by the [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-standards-and-guidelines) and released in **2001** as part of the **Secure Hash Standard (FIPS PUB 180-2)**. It was introduced to replace older hash functions like [SHA-1, which is now deprecated due to collision vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2), and to provide a stronger, modern hashing method for security, digital signatures, and data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works by splitting the message into **512-bit blocks** and running them through a series of **bitwise operations** like `XOR`, `AND`, **rotations**, and **shifts**. Understanding [bitwise operators in Python](https://realpython.com/python-bitwise-operators/) is essential for implementing these operations correctly. Functions such as `Ch`, `Maj`, and the `Sigma` functions help mix the bits so that even a **1-bit change in the input** causes a **completely different output**. This is called the **avalanche effect**, and it's a critical security property that prevents attackers from predicting how small changes affect the hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a visual walkthrough of how SHA-256 works internally, [this Computerphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMtFhACPnTY) provides an excellent explanation of how these building blocks fit into the compression function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Building Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "The seven functions I'm implementing in this problem are the fundamental **bitwise mixing operations** that SHA-256 uses internally. Additional context on [bitwise operations](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-bitwise-operators/) helps understand their behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Logical Functions (Parity, Ch, Maj):**\n",
    "These operate on three 32-bit words and produce one 32-bit output. They're used in different rounds of the compression function:\n",
    "- **Parity**: Simple XOR of all three inputs - produces 1 when an odd number of bits are 1\n",
    "- **Ch (Choose)**: Uses the first input as a selector to choose between the second and third inputs\n",
    "- **Maj (Majority)**: Returns the majority value for each bit position across the three inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Rotation Functions (Sigma0, Sigma1, sigma0, sigma1):**\n",
    "These perform **circular rotations** - bits shifted off one end wrap around to the other end. The uppercase Sigma functions use only rotations, while the lowercase sigma functions combine rotations with right shifts. These functions help spread the influence of each input bit across the entire output, creating strong **bit diffusion**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why 32-bit Operations?\n",
    "\n",
    "**SHA-256** operates exclusively on **32-bit words** because:\n",
    "- It provides a balance between security and performance\n",
    "- 32-bit operations are efficient on most modern processors\n",
    "- The 256-bit output is constructed from eight 32-bit words\n",
    "- All intermediate calculations stay within 32-bit boundaries, making overflow behavior predictable\n",
    "\n",
    "Using **NumPy's [np.uint32 type](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.scalars.html#numpy.uint32)** ensures that all operations wrap around correctly at 32 bits, matching the exact behavior specified in the **FIPS 180-4** standard. This is crucial because Python's default integer type uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic and doesn't automatically wrap.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SHA-256** is widely used for **checking data integrity**, **digital signatures**, **blockchain technology** (like Bitcoin mining), and **general security tasks**.\n",

    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "My strategy for implementing these functions follows a consistent pattern for each one, ensuring they match the **SHA-256** specification exactly:\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Implementation Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Type Conversion First:**\n",
    "For every function, I start by converting all inputs to [`np.uint32`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.scalars.html#numpy.uint32). This is critical because Python integers can be arbitrarily large, but SHA-256 requires strict 32-bit behavior. Without this conversion, operations like rotation and negation won't work correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Follow the Standard's Formulas:**\n",
    "Each function implements the exact bitwise formula specified in [**FIPS 180-4**](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf). I didn't try to optimize or simplify these - I wrote them exactly as defined because the security properties depend on these specific combinations of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Ensure 32-bit Output:**\n",
    "After computing the result, I convert it back to `np.uint32` to guarantee the output is also a proper 32-bit value. This prevents any unexpected type conversions or overflow issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function-Specific Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parity Function:**\n",
    "I implemented this using three XOR operations: `x ^ y ^ z`. The XOR operation naturally produces parity - it outputs 1 when an odd number of inputs are 1. This is a direct translation of the standard's definition and keeps the implementation simple and clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choose Function (Ch):**\n",
    "The formula `(x & y) ^ (~x & z)` might look complex, but it elegantly implements bit-selection logic. Where `x` has a 1-bit, the result takes the corresponding bit from `y`. Where `x` has a 0-bit (meaning `~x` has a 1-bit), the result takes the bit from `z`. This \"choosing\" behavior is why it's called the Choose function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Majority Function (Maj):**\n",
    "The expression `(x & y) ^ (x & z) ^ (y & z)` implements majority voting at the bit level. Each bit in the output is 1 if at least two of the corresponding input bits are 1. This works because the XOR of the three AND operations mathematically computes the majority value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rotation Functions (Sigma0, Sigma1, sigma0, sigma1):**\n",
    "For rotations, I use the pattern `(x >> n) | (x << (32-n))` ([common Python rotation implementation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5832982/how-to-get-the-logical-right-binary-rotation-in-python)):\n",
    "- The right shift `>>` moves bits to the right by `n` positions\n",
    "- The left shift `<<` moves bits to the left by `32-n` positions\n",
    "- The OR operation `|` combines them, creating the circular wrap-around effect\n",
    "\n",
    "The uppercase Sigma functions XOR three different rotations together. The lowercase sigma functions combine two rotations with a right shift (which doesn't wrap around - bits shifted off the end are lost).\n",

    "### Discussion / Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test Results\n",
    "\n",
    "All seven functions passed their comprehensive test suites, confirming that the implementations correctly follow the **FIPS 180-4** specification. The test cases covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Edge cases**: All zeros and all ones inputs\n",
    "- **Specific patterns**: Single bits, alternating patterns, known values\n",
    "- **Bit-level verification**: Binary representations to confirm exact bitwise behavior\n",
    "- **Consistency checks**: Operations with actual SHA constants\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Importance of Type Conversion:**\n",
    "During initial implementation, I discovered that failing to convert inputs to `np.uint32` caused incorrect behavior, especially with the negation operator `~` in the Choose function. Python's arbitrary-precision integers don't naturally wrap at 32 bits, so explicit type handling is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Rotation vs. Shift Distinction:**\n",
    "The difference between rotations (where bits wrap around) and shifts (where bits are lost) is critical for the sigma functions. The lowercase sigma functions combine both operations, creating different diffusion patterns than the uppercase Sigma functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Bitwise Logic:**\n",
    "The Choose and Majority functions demonstrate how bitwise operations can be for implementing conditional logic without branches. The Choose function essentially implements a 32-way multiplexer, and Majority implements 32 simultaneous majority votes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "The main challenge was ensuring that all operations stayed within 32-bit boundaries. Initially, some test cases failed because:\n",
    "- Python's default integer type doesn't automatically wrap at 32 bits\n",
    "- The negation operator behaves differently on unlimited-precision integers\n",
    "- Rotation amounts must account for the full 32-bit word size\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting all inputs to `np.uint32` at the start of each function and converting the result at the end solved these issues consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why These Functions Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "These building blocks appear throughout SHA-256's 64 rounds of processing. The Choose and Majority functions provide **nonlinearity** - they create complex relationships between bits that prevent attackers from predicting how changes propagate. The rotation functions provide **diffusion** - they spread the influence of each input bit across many output bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these functions create the **avalanche effect** that makes SHA-256 secure: changing even one bit in the input cascades through these operations to produce a completely different hash output.\n",

    "### My Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, I need to generate the **64 K constants** that SHA-256 uses in its compression function. These aren't arbitrary numbers - they come from the fractional parts of cube roots of the first 64 prime numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way I thought about it is that **cryptographic algorithms need constants that appear random but are actually derived from well-known mathematical values**. This approach, called \"nothing up my sleeve numbers,\" proves the constants weren't chosen to contain hidden weaknesses or backdoors. Anyone can verify these constants by computing the cube roots of primes themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Breaking it down:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate primes:** First, I need to find the first 64 prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ..., 311)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate cube roots:** For each prime, compute its cube root. For example, $\\sqrt[3]{2} \\approx 1.259921...$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Extract fractional part:** Take only the part after the decimal point. For $\\sqrt[3]{2}$, that's $0.259921...$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Get first 32 bits:** Multiply the fractional part by $2^{32}$ to shift it left 32 bits, then truncate to get an integer. This effectively extracts the first 32 binary digits of the fractional part.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Convert to hex:** Display as hexadecimal for easy comparison with the standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result should match exactly what's listed in **FIPS 180-4** on page 11, where all 64 constants are printed. These K constants are added to working variables during each of the 64 rounds of SHA-256's compression function, providing the \"random-looking\" mixing that makes the hash secure.\n",

    "### Theory / Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The SHA-256 K constants are defined in [Section 4.2.2 of FIPS 180-4](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf) (page 11). They represent an important design principle in modern cryptography: **verifiable randomness**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Use Cube Roots of Primes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptographic algorithms need constants that appear random but must be **transparently generated** to prove they don't contain hidden weaknesses. Using mathematical constants like cube roots of primes provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nothing Up My Sleeve**: Anyone can independently verify these constants by computing cube roots themselves\n",
    "2. **Unpredictability**: The fractional parts of cube roots produce pseudo-random bit patterns\n",
    "3. **Mathematical Beauty**: Connects SHA-256 to fundamental mathematics (prime numbers)\n",
    "4. **Historical Precedent**: Similar to how DES used the first 64 bits of $\\sqrt{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-standards-and-guidelines) chose this approach when designing SHA-256 in the late 1990s to ensure transparency and build trust in the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prime Numbers and Cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "[Prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) are fundamental building blocks in cryptography. While SHA-256 doesn't use primes for encryption (unlike RSA), using primes to generate constants connects the algorithm to well-understood number theory. The first 64 primes (2 through 311) provide enough distinct values for SHA-256's 64 rounds.\n",

    "The fractional part of a cube root represents the portion after the decimal point. When we multiply by $2^{32}$, we're essentially [shifting the binary representation](https://realpython.com/python-bitwise-operators/) left 32 positions. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\sqrt[3]{2} = 1.25992104989...$\n",
    "- Fractional part: $0.25992104989...$\n",
    "- In binary (first few bits): $0.01000011010111...$\n",
    "- Multiply by $2^{32}$: shifts left 32 bits\n",
    "- Truncate: gives the first 32 bits as an integer\n",
    "\n",
    "Using [NumPy's `cbrt` function](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.cbrt.html) provides the precision needed for this calculation, and [`np.uint32`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.scalars.html#numpy.uint32) ensures proper 32-bit wrapping.\n",

    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "My strategy for generating the K constants involves three main functions, each handling a specific part of the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Prime Generation: `primes(n)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:** Trial division with optimization\n",
    "- Start with candidate = 2\n",
    "- Check divisibility only against previously found primes\n",
    "- Stop checking when prime² > candidate (optimization)\n",
    "- Continue until we have n primes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this approach:**\n",
    "- Simple and readable for small n (64 is very manageable)\n",
    "- More sophisticated algorithms (Sieve of Eratosthenes) would be overkill\n",
    "- The [trial division method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_division) is intuitive and easy to verify\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation detail:** I use a list to accumulate primes and check each candidate against this growing list. For n=64, this runs instantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Fractional Part Extraction: `fractional_part_cube_root(prime)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:** Direct mathematical calculation\n",
    "1. Calculate cube root using [`np.cbrt()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.cbrt.html)\n",
    "2. Extract fractional part: `cube_root - floor(cube_root)`\n",
    "3. Scale by $2^{32}$ to get first 32 bits\n",
    "4. Convert to `np.uint32`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key consideration:** Using `np.cbrt()` instead of `prime**(1/3)` provides better numerical precision for floating-point calculations. The difference matters for cryptographic constants where every bit must be exact.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why multiply by $2^{32}$:**\n",
    "- The fractional part is between 0 and 1\n",
    "- Multiplying by $2^{32}$ shifts it to the integer range [0, $2^{32}-1$]\n",
    "- This extracts exactly 32 bits of the fractional part\n",
    "- Converting to `np.uint32` truncates (doesn't round) to get the integer portion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. K Constant Generation: `generate_k_constants(n=64)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:** Compose the previous two functions\n",
    "- Generate n primes using `primes(n)`\n",
    "- For each prime, calculate its K constant using `fractional_part_cube_root()`\n",
    "- Return both the K values and the primes (for verification)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Return value choice:** Returning both K values and primes allows test functions to verify:\n",
    "- Correct prime generation\n",
    "- Correct K constant calculation\n",
    "- Exact match with FIPS 180-4 specification\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Display Function: `display_hex_result()`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:** Format for human readability\n",
    "- Display 8 constants per line (matches FIPS 180-4 layout)\n",
    "- Use hexadecimal format with leading zeros: `0x{k:08x}`\n",
    "- Makes visual comparison with the standard trivial\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing Strategy:**\n",
    "- Test `primes()` against known values\n",
    "- Test `fractional_part_cube_root()` for correctness\n",
    "- Test complete K constant array against FIPS 180-4\n",
    "- All test functions use `assert` with descriptive error messages\n",
    "\n",
    "This modular approach makes each function simple to understand, test, and verify independently.\n",

    "### Discussion / Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Test Results\n",
    "\n",
    "All test functions passed, confirming that the implementation correctly generates the SHA-256 K constants according to **FIPS 180-4**:\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ **Prime generation verified**: The first 64 primes (2, 3, 5, ..., 311) are correctly generated  \n",
    "✓ **Fractional part calculation verified**: Cube root fractional parts are extracted accurately  \n",
    "✓ **K constants match standard**: All 64 constants exactly match those listed on page 11 of FIPS 180-4  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Precision Matters**\n",
    "Using `np.cbrt()` instead of `**(1/3)` provides the numerical precision needed for cryptographic constants. Even tiny floating-point errors would produce completely different K constants, breaking SHA-256 compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Mathematical Elegance**\n",
    "The K constants demonstrate how modern cryptography balances:\n",
    "- **Security**: Constants must appear random to prevent attacks\n",
    "- **Transparency**: Must be derivable from well-known mathematical values\n",
    "- **Verifiability**: Anyone can independently compute and verify them\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. \"Nothing Up My Sleeve\" Design**\n",
    "By publishing exactly how constants are generated, NIST proved SHA-256 doesn't contain hidden backdoors. If the NSA had simply said \"use these 64 random numbers,\" cryptographers would be suspicious. By saying \"use the first 32 bits of the fractional parts of cube roots of the first 64 primes,\" the constants are:\n",
    "- Provably derived from mathematics\n",
    "- Independently verifiable by anyone\n",
    "- Free from hidden structure or weaknesses\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Connection to Hash Security**\n",
    "These K constants are critical to SHA-256's security:\n",
    "- Added during each of 64 compression rounds\n",
    "- Prevent symmetry in the hash computation\n",
    "- Ensure each round produces different mixing patterns\n",
    "- Work together with the Ch, Maj, Sigma, and sigma functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Historical Context**\n",
    "The choice of cube roots (versus square roots or other powers) was deliberate:\n",
    "- Square roots used for H constants (initial hash values)\n",
    "- Cube roots used for K constants (round constants)\n",
    "- Fourth roots used in SHA-512\n",
    "- This variety prevents any single mathematical relationship between different constant sets\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Verification\n",
    "\n",
    "The final K constant array can be directly compared to **FIPS 180-4 page 11**. For example, the first 8 constants are:\n",
    "\n",
    "0x428a2f98, 0x71374491, 0xb5c0fbcf, 0xe9b5dba5,\n",
    "0x3956c25b, 0x59f111f1, 0x923f82a4, 0xab1c5ed5\n",
    "\n",
    "These match the standard exactly, confirming the implementation is correct. This verification is crucial - even a single incorrect constant would cause SHA-256 to produce completely wrong hashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practical Application\n",
    "\n",
    "While we don't typically regenerate these constants (they're usually hardcoded in SHA-256 implementations), understanding their derivation:\n",
    "- Demonstrates the transparency principle in cryptographic design\n",
    "- Provides confidence in the algorithm's integrity\n",
    "- Shows how mathematics grounds modern security\n",
    "- Illustrates the importance of reproducible, verifiable constants\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to independently derive and verify these constants is fundamental to trusting SHA-256 for critical applications like digital signatures, blockchain, password storage, and data integrity verification.\n",

    "### SHA-256 Message Preprocessing: Padding and Block Parsing\n",
    "\n",
    "The `block_parse(msg)` generator function implements the message preprocessing steps required by SHA-256, as specified in **Sections 5.1.1 and 5.2.1** of the Secure Hash Standard ([FIPS 180-4](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf)). Message preprocessing is the first stage of the hashing process, transforming variable-length input messages into standardized 512-bit blocks that the hash computation can process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Preprocessing Matters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "SHA-256's compression function operates on fixed-size 512-bit blocks. Since real-world messages rarely align perfectly with this block size, preprocessing ensures every message can be processed uniformly. The padding scheme also serves a security purpose: it prevents collision attacks where an attacker might craft different messages that produce identical padded outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Foundation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The padding equation *ℓ* + 1 + *k* + 64 ≡ 0 (mod 512) can be rearranged to *ℓ* + 1 + *k* ≡ 448 (mod 512). This guarantees that regardless of the original message length, after adding the '1' bit and appropriate zeros, exactly 64 bits remain in the final 512-bit block for the length field. The modular arithmetic ensures this works for messages requiring one padding block or spanning multiple blocks."
